**High Availability Cluster with DRBD, Pacemaker and Squid**

We are going to use DRBD (Distributed Redundant Block Device), Pacemaker and Squid Server for Synchronization and High Availability Cluster will also be created.
The role of DRBD is to establish synchronization between two systems and allows the replication of data
These are the steps we are going to follow to achieve synchronization:
1. Establishing Connection between Machines
2. Stopping unnecessary services and running iptables command
3. Checking NTP services
4. Making LVM for DRBD 

4a) Creating partitions
4b) Creating physical volume
4c) Creating volume group
4d) Create logical volume

5. Including entries in sysctl config file
6. Installing and Configuring DRBD
7. Installing and Configuring Pacemaker
8. Setting up Squid Server

**1: ESTABLISHING CONNECTION BETWEEN MACHINES**

First we need to check IP on both Centos machines, `szabist` and `szabist1` by typing command:

    ifconfig
IP's of both machines:
`192.168.117.138` szabist1
`192.168.117.128` szabist
Now we have to add them in the hosts file
the command will be 

    vim /etc/hosts
   Add these entries in the file:
 

    192.168.117.138 szabist1
    192.168.117.128 szabist
   Now save the files and type below commands on each machine to check if they are connected

       ping szabist
       ping szabist1
**2: STOPPING UNNECESSARY SERVICES AND RUNNING IP TABLES COMMAND**

In this step first we need to disable services like cups.path. The command below will be used for disabling:

    systemctl disable cups.path

Now we have to check the command is actually disabled.

    systemctl status cups.path
Now we have to flush ip tables on both machines by typing below command:

    iptables -F

To check output type the below command.

    iptables -L

Now we have to save this IP table by typing below command.

    sudo service iptables save

**3: CHECKING NTP SERVICE**

Now we have to check if NTP(Network Time Protocol) is installed and working on both machines or not because it is important to check if both servers are synchronized with each other.
Type below command to check NTP service is installed or not.  

    rpm -qa | grep 'chrony'

Now we have to enable our machine ip for NTP request by changing the entry in the configuration file of chrony.

    vim /etc/chrony.conf
Now, we have to allow both our machine's IPs.

    allow 192.168.117.128
    allow 192.168.117.138
Restart the chrony service.

    systemctl restart chronyd
Now, type this command to allow the NTP incoming requests.

    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ntp
    firewall-cmd --reload
**4: MAKING LVM FOR DRBD**

**4a) Creating partitions for LVM** 
First we have to create LVM partitions on both machines.

To check details of disk we have to type command:

    fdisk -l

The second step will be to create partitions in sdb so we will do that by typing below command.

    fdisk /dev/sdb

Now press n for creating new partitions
After that, press p for primary. Now press enter by selecting all options as default. A new partition will be created. 
For converting type from Linux to Linux LVM we have to change HEX code to 8e. for that we have type t then provide the code 8e.
Now save all the changes by pressing w.

**4b) Creating physical volume**
For creating physical volume type the following command.

    pvcreate /dev/sdb1

**4c) Creating Volume Group**
for creating volume group type the following command 

    vgcreate vgdrbd /dev/sdb1

**4d) Creating Logical Volume**
Now for creating logical volume we have type following command.

    lvcreate -n lvdrbd /dev/mapper/vgdrbd -L +3000M
Now make the filesystem by typing the command:

    mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/vgdrbd-lvdrbd

**5: INCLUDING ENTRIES IN SYSCTL CONFIG FILE**

We will add few entries in the sysctl config file of both the machines by typing below command.

    vi etc/sysctl.conf

    net.ipv4.conf.ens33.arp_ignore = 1
    net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_announce = 2
    net.ipv4.conf.ens33.arp_announce = 2
    
Now look at the output by typing below command:

    sysctl -p
**6: INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING DRBD**

By the help of the following command, you can install drbd on both machines:
`dnf -y install https://download-ib01.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/8/Everything/x86_64/Packages/d/drbd-9.17.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm`

By the help of the following command, you can install drbd-utils:
`dnf -y install https://download-ib01.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/8/Everything/x86_64/Packages/d/drbd-utils-9.17.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm`

By the help of the following command, you can install kernel module for drbd:
`dnf -y install https://mirror.rackspace.com/elrepo/elrepo/el8/x86_64/RPMS/kmod-drbd90-9.1.5-1.el8_5.elrepo.x86_64.rpm`

After the complete installation of drbd, make a new file, and make changes.

    nano /etc/drbd.d/resource0.res

    resource resource0 {
    protocol C;
    on szabist {
    device /dev/drbd0;
    disk /dev/vgdrbd/lvdrbd;
    address 192.168.117.128:7788;
    meta-disk internal;
    }
    on szabist1 {
    device /dev/drbd0;
    disk /dev/vgdrbd/lvdrbd;
    address 192.168.117.138:7788;
    meta-disk internal;
    }
    }



Allow the port  `7788`  on the firewall to avoid any kind of issue.
`firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port 7788/tcp`  

Reload using this command:
`firewall-cmd --reload`

Start DRBD by using the following command:

    modprobe drbd
    
Now echo modprobe drd in rc.local by the following command:

    echo "modprobe drbd" >> /etc/rc.local
    
Initialize the DRBD resource by this command:

    drbdadm create-md resource0
    
Now, enable the resource:

    drbdadm up resource0
    
Check the status of the drbd:

    drbdadm status resource0
    
On your first machine, start the initial full synchronization:

    drbdadm primary --force resource0
    
Now, check the status:

    drbdadm status resource0
    
Your output will change from the previous one.

Now create the filesystem:

    mkfs.ext4 /dev/drbd0
Mount the DRBD device on any directory, we are using /opt:

    mount /dev/drbd0 /opt/
Create some files inside /opt directory by using command:

    cd /opt
    touch file1 file2 file3
Now, on the first machine, unmount the DRBD and make it secondary:

    cd
    umount /opt
    drbdadm secondary resource0
On the  second machine, make the second node primary with this command:

    drbdadm primary resource0

Now, mount the DRBD device on the /opt directory with the following command:

    mount /dev/drbd0 /opt

Type and run this command to print the list of files in the /opt directory:

    ls /opt
    
All the files stored in the DRBD device will be shown there. Here, the installation and configuration of DRBD is successful. 

**7: INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING PACEMAKER**

Now, enable the High Availability Repo and install pacemaker:

    dnf --enablerepo=ha -y install pacemaker pcs
Now, enable pcs:

    systemctl enable --now pcsd
Set the password for the cluster admin:

    passwd hacluster
Allow the HA service:

    firewall-cmd --add-service=high-availability --permanent
    firewall-cmd --reload
Create authorization among nodes and configure basic cluster settings:

    pcs host auth szabist szabist1
    
    pcs cluster setup ha_cluster szabist szabist1
Start services for cluster:

    pcs cluster start --all

Make it auto-start:

    pcs cluster enable --all

Now check status:

    pcs cluster status
The output will be following:

    Cluster Status:
     Cluster Summary:
       * Stack: corosync
       * Current DC: szabist1 (version 2.1.0-8.el8-7c3f660707) - partition with quorum
       * Last updated: Wed Jan 26 15:30:29 2022
       * Last change:  Tue Jan 25 05:44:32 2022 by hacluster via crmd on szabist
       * 2 nodes configured
       * 0 resource instances configured
     Node List:
       * Online: [ szabist szabist1 ]
    
    PCSD Status:
      szabist: Online
      szabist1: Online

Also check the status for corosync:

    pcs status corosync

The output will be following:

    Membership information
    ----------------------
        Nodeid      Votes Name
             1          1 szabist
             2          1 szabist1 (local)
**8: SETTING UP SQUID**

Install squid using the following command:

    dnf install squid -y

Back up the configuration file:

    sudo cp /etc/squid/squid.conf /etc/squid/squid.conf.ori

Access the configuration file:

    vim /etc/squid/squid.conf

Allow squid on the firewall:

    firewall-cmd --add-service=squid --permanent 
    firewall-cmd --reload

Now it's time for the configuration of CentOS client:

    sudo vim /etc/profile.d/proxyserver.sh

Add these settings:

    MY_PROXY_URL="szabist:3128" 
    HTTP_PROXY=$MY_PROXY_URL
    HTTPS_PROXY=$MY_PROXY_URL
    FTP_PROXY=$MY_PROXY_URL
    http_proxy=$MY_PROXY_URL
    https_proxy=$MY_PROXY_URL
    ftp_proxy=$MY_PROXY_URL

Then finally source the file:

    source /etc/profile.d/proxyserver.sh

The squid proxy has successfully been installed.
